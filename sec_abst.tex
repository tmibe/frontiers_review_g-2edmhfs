\section{}
In this review, we discuss physics of muon anomalous magnetic moment ($g-2$) and electric dipole moment (EDM),
experimental progress, as well as related studies such as spectroscopy of a muonium atom. Muon's ($g-2$) and 
EDM are sensitive to new particles and/or interactions beyond the standard model of particle physics. 
Precise calculations of contributions from the standard model have been made. The previous measurement 
of $g-2$ at BNL suggested an excess over the standard model prediction at a significance of 3 standard 
deviations. New independent measurements and improvements in theoretical calculation are long awaited 
to establish the deviation in muon’s $g-2$. Technological advances in particle accelerator complex offer 
opportunities to carry out new experiments with improved precision on muon’s $g-2$ and EDM. 
Present status is briefly reviewed in this paper.
